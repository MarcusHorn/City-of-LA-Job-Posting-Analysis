    "1. First, make sure to scrub the job descriptions of unexplained acronyms or jargon; this would intuitively bias the candidate pool towards those already intimately familiar with the specific job functions and protocols at a given organization and discourages diversity. In code, check for any instances consecutive capital letters (excluding headers), for example DMV, that may be acronyms and examine if they are properly explained. You might also hard code checks for jargon indicators such as 'Department' or 'Section #'.\n",
